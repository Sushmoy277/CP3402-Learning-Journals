The purpose of this journal is to document my learning progress, reflections, and skill development throughout the semester. Each week includes:

- Learning activities and resources used

- Content insights (what I understood and learned)
- Career and employability reflections



## Purpose of This Journal

This journal helps me:

- Reflect on what I am learning each week
- Improve my understanding of CMS concepts
- Develop problem-solving and debugging skills
- Track my progress over time
- Connect technical learning with real-world employability skills

It also provides clear evidence of my learning activities and effort outside class.



This repository is part of my academic work and demonstrates my continuous learning and reflection throughout the subject.
