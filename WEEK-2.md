# Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I focused on understanding how Joomla CMS works properly. At first, I was just exploring the dashboard, but I realised I needed to actually learn how the system is structured. I watched YouTube tutorials about Joomla, especially how menus connect to articles and how templates control the design of the website.

I also read parts of the Joomla documentation to better understand how the Cassiopeia template works. To improve the design of my website, I researched modern study-abroad websites like IDP and Studyportals. I observed how they use spacing, headings, and sections to make their websites look clean and professional.

In addition, I used ChatGPT to help me understand CSS styling, debugging problems, and how to modernise my website layout. Instead of only copying solutions, I tried to understand why certain changes worked and why others did not.


## Estimated Hours

Approximately **7–8 hours** .



## Content Insights

This week I learned that Joomla works very differently from a static website. I was confused at first because I could not find where my homepage content was stored. Later, I understood that my homepage was connected to a "Single Article" through the menu system. This helped me understand how Joomla connects menus, articles, and templates together.

I also learned about caching and CSS overrides. When my design changes were not appearing, I initially thought I had made a mistake. Later, I realised the issue was caused by caching. After clearing the cache and testing small changes, I understood how important it is to check system settings before assuming the code is wrong.

Another important insight was about modern website design. After comparing my site with professional websites, I realised my site looked outdated because it lacked spacing and structure. Modern websites use white space, larger headings, and clear sections to improve readability. I learned that good design is not just about colour but also about layout and user experience.



## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This week helped me understand how CMS systems are used in real industry environments. Many companies use platforms like Joomla instead of building everything from scratch. Learning how to customise templates and manage layout is an important skill for web development roles.

I also improved my problem-solving approach. When something did not work, I felt frustrated at first. However, instead of randomly trying different fixes, I started testing small changes step-by-step. For example, I temporarily changed the background colour to confirm whether my CSS file was loading. This helped me debug issues more logically.

Researching professional websites also changed how I think about building websites. I started thinking about how users experience a website and how design influences trust and professionalism. This is important for employability because employers value developers who understand both technical implementation and user experience.

Overall, this week improved my understanding of Joomla and strengthened my confidence in troubleshooting and improving website design systematically.
