# Week 3

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I focused on properly understanding how WordPress block themes work, especially templates, pages, and navigation. After facing repeated linking errors, I realised I did not fully understand the structure of WordPress. Instead of randomly trying to fix errors, I decided to learn how the system actually works.

I used the following resources:

- WordPress Template Hierarchy Documentation  
  https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/

- WordPress Block Editor Handbook  
  https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/

- WordPress Permalinks Guide  
  https://wordpress.org/support/article/settings-permalinks/

- YouTube tutorials explaining Full Site Editing (FSE) and the Navigation block

These resources helped me understand why my pages were not linking correctly and why templates were not behaving as I expected.



## Estimated Hours

**6 hours** of focused learning .



## Content Insights

The most important concept I learned this week was that templates and pages are not the same thing.

Previously, I assumed that editing a template automatically created a page. I now understand that:

- Templates control layout and structure.
- Pages contain actual content and generate URLs.
- Navigation menus must link to published pages.
- If a page does not exist or is unpublished, the link will produce an error.
- Permalinks sometimes need to be refreshed to fix routing issues.

This helped me see WordPress as a structured content management system rather than just a visual editor. I also learned that the header and footer are global template parts. Editing them in the Site Editor changes them across the entire website.

A major shift in my thinking was moving from “something is broken” to asking “which part of the structure is causing this issue?” That structural thinking improved my problem solving approach.


## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This week helped me develop a more professional mindset when facing technical issues.

At first, I reacted emotionally to errors such as “item does not exist.” However, once I understood the system structure, the problems became logical instead of frustrating. In a workplace environment, developers are expected to analyse systems and diagnose root causes rather than panic when something fails.

I also realised that trial and error learning is inefficient. Reading official documentation gave me clearer understanding than repeatedly changing settings without understanding them.

I discovered that my most effective learning process is:
1. Watch a short tutorial.
2. Immediately apply what I learned.
3. Reinforce understanding by reading documentation.

This week moved me from simply editing content to understanding how a CMS functions internally. That deeper understanding increases my confidence and prepares me for more complex web development work in the future.
