# Learning Journal-1

## Week
**Week 1 – Basic Web Design & Introduction to CMS**

---

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on learning the basics of web design and understanding what a Content Management System (CMS) is.  
My main learning methods were **searching on Google**, **watching YouTube videos**, **reading online documentation**, and **taking help from ChatGPT** to better understand concepts and write code.

Learning activities I completed:
- Searched on **Google** to understand static websites and how they are published online.
- Watched **YouTube videos** to learn what a CMS is and how it is used in real websites.
- Read beginner documentation on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- Learned basic **Markdown** syntax for writing my learning journal.
- Used **ChatGPT** to help understand HTML/CSS concepts and to assist in writing and structuring the website code.

YouTube videos watched about CMS:

## Estimated Hours
**4-5 hours**



## Content Insights
This week helped me understand the basic difference between **HTML and CSS**. HTML is used to create the structure of a website, such as headings, text, links, and forms. CSS is used to control how the website looks, including colours, spacing, and layout.

From the YouTube videos about CMS, I learned that a **Content Management System** allows users to create and manage website content using an admin dashboard instead of writing code every time. CMS platforms make it easier to update content, manage menus, and control the design using templates.

I also learned that common CMS platforms include **Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal**, and they are widely used for business and organisational websites. CMS separates content from design, which makes websites easier to maintain and update.

Using Bootstrap helped me understand how responsive layouts can be created more easily. I also learned that a static website is still useful for presenting ideas clearly, even without backend functionality.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
This week showed me that learning web development usually involves using multiple resources together. Searching on Google, watching YouTube videos, reading documentation, and using ChatGPT helped me learn more efficiently than relying on only one source.

I realised that I learn better when I watch short videos and then immediately practise what I learned. Long videos were less effective for me, but short tutorials followed by practice helped me stay focused.

Learning how CMS works is important because many real-world websites use CMS platforms. Understanding CMS, along with basic HTML and CSS, improves my employability for roles related to web development and content management.

Learning Markdown is also useful because it is commonly used in industry for documentation and project communication. Overall, this week helped me improve my independent learning skills and use modern tools responsibly.
